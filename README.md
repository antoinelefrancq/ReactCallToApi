# Small React Projet to call an extern API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this projet to practice an extern API call in a React project.

## Steps needed

- first, you need to `npm i` to install all the dependancies.
- then, you need to create a `.env` file like the `.env.example` file with a correct key find on [openWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) (an accoumpte is needed)
- at least, type `npm start` to launch the application and make it run on the port 3000.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm i`

It install all the dependancies.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
